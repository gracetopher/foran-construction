==================

Showcase of code for my project for Foran Construction Ltd. This project demonstrates how I have used PHP to template 
the website, while using dynamic Meta tags for Search Engine Optimisation.

[See files for comments]

index.php

The index file shows I have used PHP include statements to add the header and footer. Before the header is 
included, I have added PHP variables for the Meta data (title, description and keywords). For SEO purposes, 
these Meta tags change on every page so it was important that I make them vary inside the header template.

header.php shows how I have included these Meta tag variables.
